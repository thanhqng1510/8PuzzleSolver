8-Puzzle Solver


1. How to compile and run code:
 
Run from terminal as: `python3 main.py -h` to see more information

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -i, --input      8-puzzle input, format of <0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8>
  -b, --benchmark  run benchmark to calculate search cost of each depth

Use argument -b for benchmarking, -i to input a puzzle and solve it, no argument to randomly generated a puzzle and solve it.


2. Estimating the degree of completion level for each requirement:
- Successfully solve an input 8 puzzle     (completed)
- Testing 100 cases and make comparison    (completed)
- Checking if 8-puzzle is solvable	 (completed)	
- Linear conflict heuristic		 (not completed)		
- Report and policy in â€œWhat to submit"    (completed)
